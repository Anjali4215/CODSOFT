📌 Overview

This project is a simple calculator application built using Python.
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program is interactive, runs in the terminal, and can be used multiple times until the user chooses to exit.

🛠️ How It Works

The program starts with a menu asking the user to input two numbers.

The user then selects an operation from the menu:

1 → Addition

2 → Subtraction

3 → Multiplication

4 → Division

5 → Exit

Based on the choice, the corresponding function (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is executed.

The result is displayed in a user-friendly format.

The menu repeats until the user chooses Exit.
